    "text": "This collaboration began with a simple idea — to help students in food science and technology understand statistics better. When I was a lecturer, I often saw how students struggled with statistics. I wanted to make it easier and more relevant to their future work in the food industry.\nBetween 2017 and 2020, I discovered the book Statistics for Food Scientists: Making Sense of the Numbers by Frank Rossi and Viktor Mirtchev, published by Academic Press (Elsevier). I felt it was exactly the kind of book that could bridge the gap between theory and practice. Years later, I reached out to Elsevier to request permission to translate and adapt it into Bahasa Indonesia.\nAfter several months of communication, Elsevier kindly granted permission for translation and adaptation. To publish it locally, I partnered with IPB Press, a reputable academic publisher in Indonesia. Together, we developed the Indonesian edition titled Statistika untuk Mahasiswa Sains dan Teknologi: Simulasi Magang di R&D Industri Pangan.\nThis adaptation is more than just a translation. It was designed to fit the Indonesian learning context — combining academic rigor with practical insight from industry. I also invited professors, industry leaders, and education figures to contribute testimonials and reflections on the importance of statistical literacy for students.\nIn 2025, the book was officially published and is now available on the IPB Press website.\nThis project has been a meaningful journey for me — combining my passion for education, science communication, and collaboration. It reminded me why I started foodsaintika: to make scientific knowledge more accessible and inspiring for future food scientists."
