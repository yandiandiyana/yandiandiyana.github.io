title: "Online Training - Collaboration with IPB Training"

In 2025, I had the opportunity to collaborate with [*IPB Training*](https://www.instagram.com/ipb.training/), who invited me — as the translator of the book Statistika untuk Mahasiswa Sains dan Teknologi: Simulasi Magang di R&D Industri Pangan — to lead a one-day workshop using the book as the main material.

The workshop, titled "Simulasi Menjadi Food Scientist: Praktik Analisis Data dan Desain Eksperimen di R&D Industri Pangan", was held on Saturday, 2 August 2025.

It was designed as a hands-on session to help participants experience how data analysis and experimental design are applied in food industry R&D environments. The workshop emphasized statistical thinking, practical simulation, and problem-solving approaches — bringing the concepts from the book into real-world practice.

The session was successfully conducted with 23 participants, including university students, researchers, lecturers, and industry professionals. Their enthusiasm and engagement showed how relevant and needed this kind of applied training is for bridging academic learning with industrial practice.

This collaboration marks another meaningful step for [*foodsaintika*](https://www.instagram.com/foodsaintika/) — connecting education, research, and industry through accessible learning experiences in food science and technology.
